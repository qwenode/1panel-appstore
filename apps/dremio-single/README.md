Dremio 是一个简单、开放的湖屋平台。数据团队使用 Dremio 提供自助分析，同时享受在同一数据上使用 Dremio 闪电般快速的 SQL 引擎和任何其他处理引擎的灵活性。

Dremio是一款DaaS（Data-as-a-Service）数据即服务平台，可对接多类数据源(pgsql/es/mysql/mongodb/csv 等等)来进行BI分析

Dremio is an easy and open lakehouse platform. Data teams use Dremio to deliver self-service analytics, while enjoying the flexibility to use Dremio's lightning-fast SQL engine and any other processing engine on the same data.

Dremio enables analysts to explore and visualize data with sub-second query response times, and enables data engineers to ingest and transform data directly in the data lake with full support for DML operations. In addition, analysts can join data in the lake with data in external databases, so they don't have to move data into object storage to derive value from that data. Dremio's open lakehouse platform, based on community-driven standards like Apache Iceberg and Apache Arrow, enables organizations to use best-in-class processing engines and eliminates vendor lock-in.

Dremio is also the co-creator of Apache Arrow, a platform for columnar in-memory processing. Arrow is used extensively by Dremio, and is core to many other open source projects. Read more about the origin & history of Apache Arrow.
