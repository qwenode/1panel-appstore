## About

[Screenshots](https://elasticvue.com/features)

**Elasticvue** is a free and open-source gui for elasticsearch that you can use to manage the data in your cluster.
It has full support for elasticsearch versions `8.x`, `7.x` and `6.8`. Check
the [FAQ](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/wiki/FAQ) for more details.

### Features

* Cluster overview
* Index & alias management
* Shard management
* Searching and editing documents
* Rest queries
* Snapshot & repository management

## Usage

You can use elasticvue in several ways:

* [**Desktop app for linux, mac and windows, recommended**](#desktop-app)
* [Browser extension for chrome, firefox and edge](#browser-extensions)
* [Docker image](#docker)
* [Web version](#web-version)
* [Self-hosted](#self-hosted)

### Desktop App

Please check the [releases page](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/releases) for the latest desktop app download.

### Browser extensions

* [Google chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticvue/hkedbapjpblbodpgbajblpnlpenaebaa)
* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elasticvue/)
* [Microsoft edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/geifniocjfnfilcbeloeidajlfmhdlgo)

Start elasticvue by clicking on the icon in your toolbar.

### Docker

*You have to configure your elasticsearch cluster if you use elasticvue via docker*  
Use the [existing image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cars10/elasticvue):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name elasticvue -d cars10/elasticvue
```

### Web version

*You have to configure your elasticsearch cluster if you use the web version of elasticvue*  
Visit [https://app.elasticvue.com](https://app.elasticvue.com).

### Self-hosted

*You have to configure your elasticsearch cluster if you use a self-hosted version of elasticvue*  
Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/wiki/Building-Elasticvue) for more information.

## Elasticsearch configuration

You have to [enable CORS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html) to allow
connection to your elasticsearch cluster **if you do not use the desktop app or the browser extensions**.

Find your elasticsearch configuration (for example `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`) and add the following lines:

```yaml
# enable CORS
http.cors.enabled: true

# Then set the allowed origins based on how you run elasticvue. Chose only one:
# for docker / running locally
http.cors.allow-origin: "http://localhost:8080"
# online version
http.cors.allow-origin: /https?:\/\/app.elasticvue.com/

# and if your cluster uses authorization you also have to add:
http.cors.allow-headers: X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization
```

If you use docker to run your elasticsearch cluster you can pass the options via environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 \
           -e "http.cors.enabled=true" \
           -e "http.cors.allow-origin=/.*/" \
           elasticsearch
```

After configuration restart your cluster and you should be able to connect.

## Browser Support

Any current version of Chrome, Firefox and Edge (Chromium) should work without issues.

## Troubleshooting

Before opening an issue please try to reset elasticvue to its default settings:

1. Open the settings
2. Download a backup of your current elasticvue data
3. Click `Disconnect and reset`

This will reset all your saved filters, and you have to reconnect to your cluster. Please open
an [issue](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/issues/new/choose) if your problem persists.

## Comparing with other frontends

See the Wiki. [Comparing to other frontends](https://github.com/cars10/elasticvue/wiki/Comparing-to-other-frontends)

## i18n

Elasticvue is available in the following languages:

* english
* chinese (about 80% translated)

### Help wanted

I do not speak chinese and therefore rely on your help to keep the chinese translation up-to-date. Please open a PR if
you notice missing/wrong translations in the chinese version.

### Adding a new language

If you want to add a new language: translate `src/locales/en.json` and open a PR.
